## Sihao Wu 

I'm a Ph.D candidate in [Autonomous Cyber Physical Systems (ACPS) Lab](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~acps/home/) at [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/) and [Dr. Xingyu Zhao](https://www.xzhao.me/home).  My research areas includes transfer learning, domain adaptation and multi-task learning. Prior to my Ph.D. program, I was working on vehicle trainsmission control supervised by [Prof. Xiangyang Xu](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/xuxiangyang/en/index.htm) and [Assoc. Prof. Peng Dong](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/dpgoal/en/index.htm) in [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/).

My research interests include <b>Generalization</b>, <b>Deep Reinforcement Learning</b> and <b>Sequential Decision Making</b>. I am eagerly in deploying <b>Robust DRL</b> algorithms to real robotics systems, like autonomous vehicles.
